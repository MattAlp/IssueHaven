# IssueHaven

Still very WIP and already eating up all of my free time :')

Finds good issues for beginners on Github and categorizes them for easy lookup

Consists of a Flask server that acts as a search engine, and a few Python scripts that aggregate issues

# TODO
* Add categories and doc tags

* Add rate limiting logic when aggregating issues for different categories

* Flesh out Flask component of project
